== January 8: Lab 0

https://github.com/lawrancej/COMP3670-2016/blob/master/Setup.adoc[Setup all software]
and https://github.com/lawrancej/COMP3670-2016/blob/master/Git.adoc[git].

== January 12: Lab 1

. Write a home page
. Write down project ideas (look around at existing web applications)
. Begin to think about who to work with

Github can serve files in your repo under the `gh-pages` branch.

----
# create the gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages
# push the gh-pages branch to github
git push origin gh-pages
----

Once there, any html in that branch will be accessible via your-user-name.github.io.

For example, go to: http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP3670-2016/Code/example.html

== January 26: Lab 2
Implement Mad Libs! as a web application using Node.js, http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html[Express.js] and http://handlebarsjs.com/[Handlebars].
To get an idea of what it may look like, see http://www.madglibs.com/showglib.php?glibid=188[an example here].

*HINT:* You may want to use a POST request.

== February 3: Lab 3: Low-fidelity prototype

Answer a few questions about your project:

* Who is your audience?
* What problem are you trying to solve?
* Why wouldn't they just use something else? (It's okay to reimplement a known thing)
* Are you planning to improve upon what already exists? If so, how?

Prototype (mockup) your system

Low-fidelity prototype your entire system.
Low-fidelity means that it's obvious it's just a sketch, not an implementation.
That way, feedback is focused on features or viability, not fonts or placement.

You can use:

* Paper (literally)
* http://pencil.evolus.vn/[Pencil]
* Paint ;-)

== February 9: Complete Lab 3

We'll give feedback on each other's project prototypes.

. For the person with the prototype, without saying anything, watch what the user does.
. Watch the "user" think aloud and *listen* for 2-3 minutes or so.
. Take notes.
. Explain the system, and have a conversation.
. Take turns.
