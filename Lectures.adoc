=== Introduce yourself
Welcome! Let's get to know each other with an icebreaker. Answer these questions:

* What is your name?
* What is your major and why did you pick it?
* Tell us something nobody else in the room knows about you.

== January 11

Let's dive into HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hello world</title>
<!-- This is a comment -->
</head>
<body>
Hello, world!

== January 13: Node.js

https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/[Font awesome] is a collection of useful icons.

To test that node is working correctly, do the following in the command line:
----
cd ~/COMP3670-2016
git pull upstream master
cd Code
node node-example.js
----

Go to: http://127.0.0.1:1337/ and it should say `Hello World`

== January 15: npm and Express.js

`npm` is node.js' package manager (hence the name).
You can create packages (i.e., your web app) using `npm init`.

Some packages are meant for global installation, like http://browserify.org/[`browserify`] and https://mochajs.org/[`mocha`], installed earlier.

Other packages only make sense as a dependency for your own package, like `express`, a web framework for node.js.

Type these commands, but don't copy/paste, because `npm init` is interactive.

----
cd ~/COMP3670-2016
mkdir -p Code/example-app
cd Code/example-app
npm init
echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
npm install express --save
npm install express-handlebars --save
touch index.js
----

Go here and copy paste: http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html[Hello world in express] into `index.js`.

Then, in the command line, run it.

----
node index.js
----

To see that it works, go to http://localhost:3000/

Now, let's serve static files.

----
mkdir public
touch public/index.html
----

Fill `public/index.html` with something sensible.

Add this line to `index.js` (after `var app = express();`) and save:

----
// serve up any request to /static using files from public
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
----

Next, stop `node` with `Ctrl-C` and re-run it:

----
node index.js
----

Then, go to http://localhost:3000/static

That page is served statically.

== January 19: Bootstrap, Handlebars

http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/[Bootstrap] is a popular front-end framework.
It has a grid system (for layouts that respond to screen size),
as well as nice default styles for things like navigation bars and alerts.

Copy this HTML into your html's `head`

----

http://semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI] is similar to bootstrap, but has additional styling.

http://handlebarsjs.com/[Handlebars] is a template system, enabling separation of html (view) from code (model).
Handlebars replaces placeholders in a file with data from a http://json.org/example.html[JavaScript object (JSON)]
Placeholders come in two varieties; double-stash `{{placeholder}}` or triple-stash `{{{placeholder}}}`
Handlebars escapes HTML into http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp[HTML entities] for double-stash placeholders, but not for triple-stash placeholders.

Let's https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars[add handlebars to express], as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ribwPpIPw[demonstrated on youtube]

If you want to see my express code, do this:

----
cd ~/COMP3670-2016
git fetch --all
# merge latest from master
git merge upstream/master
# look at my code
git checkout upstream/express-example
# create a local branch that tracks upstream
git checkout -b express-example
# Get updates to express-example
git pull upstream express-example
# go back to the master branch
git checkout master
----

== January 20: HTML Forms

Input from forms into the backend.

URL: Uniform Resource Locator (paths for the web)

Absolute URLs:

----
scheme://domain/path/to/something?key=value&anotherKey=anotherValue
scheme://domain/path/to/something#fragment
----

Relative URLs:
Suppose we are at `http://localhost:3000/some/place.html`

----
/another-place
# the absolute URL is http://localhost:3000/another-place
another-place
# the absolute URL is http://localhost:3000/some/another-place
../some-place-secret
# the absolute URL is http://localhost:3000/some-place-secret
----

action is where we send form data to (that's a URL)
method is how we send data to our "action"
URL

* HTML forms
* HTTP methods, requests, responses
* URL encodings

== January 22: HTTP methods, form POST

HTTP methods

[horizontal]
HEAD:: Get response headers only
GET:: (_Default method_) Access resources
POST:: Modify something on the server
OPTIONS:: HTTP proxy or CORS requests
PUT:: Add a resource on the server
DELETE:: Remove a resource on the server

== How to get my example app

----
cd ~/COMP3670-2016/Code/example-app/
git fetch --all
git stash
git checkout upstream/express-example
git checkout -b express-example
npm install
node index.js
----

== January 25: Speed dating / CSS

Find a partner and exchange ideas for the class project.

http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp[CSS selects] HTML elements to style using a `selector { style-key: value; }` syntax.

https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm[Use em for CSS sizes]

== January 27: Databases

----
cd ~/COMP3670-2016
npm install express-generator -g
express --hbs database
cd database
npm install
npm start
----

* http://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html[Database integration in express]
* https://www.sqlite.org/download.html[Download SQLite-tools (Windows users)]
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3[SQLite with node]
* http://sqlitebrowser.org/[SQLite browser]

----
$ sqlite3 data.db
SQLite version 3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> create table posts (title, content, author);
sqlite> insert into posts values ("Some title", "Some content", "Joey");
sqlite> select * from posts;
Some title|Some content|Joey
sqlite> .quit
----

Put this somewhere in `app.js`:

----
var sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
var db = new sqlite3.Database('data.db');

db.serialize(function() {
  db.each('SELECT * FROM posts', function(err, row) {
    console.log(row.title + ': ' + row.content + ': ' + row.author);
  });
});

db.close();
----

== January 29: Databases with Handlebars

== February 2: React

Use browserify to get started with React, a view library for the front-end.
React serves as the view layer for front-end applications.
It reacts (hence the name) to changes to state and issues changes to the DOM (Document Object Model) only when necessary.

----
cd COMP3670-2016
git fetch --all
git merge upstream/react-example
cd react-example
npm install --save react react-dom babelify babel-preset-react
browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] main.js -o bundle.js
open index.html     # Mac OS X

== February 16: AJAX and JQuery

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a way to submit and receive information without leaving the page.
This is how we have single-page applications such as Google Maps.

The native API for AJAX was developed by Microsoft for Internet Explorer,
and it looks horrible.

JQuery is an old library for simplifying cross-browser development.
Since `$` is a valid identifier in JavaScript, JQuery defines a function called `$`
to select elements by CSS selector, to which we can add event handlers, or modify in place.
JQuery has a simple AJAX API. Feel free to peruse the sample code in `ajax.html`.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for the web are typically documented with `curl`,
a command line tool for performing web requests.

Example API (for https://developer.github.com/v3/users/[GitHub]):

----
$ curl https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej
{
  "login": "lawrancej",
  "id": 600809,
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600809?v=3",
  "gravatar_id": "",
  "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/lawrancej",
  "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/followers",
  "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/following{/other_user}",
  "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/gists{/gist_id}",
  "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/starred{/owner}{/repo}",
  "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/subscriptions",
  "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/orgs",
  "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/repos",
  "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/events{/privacy}",
  "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrancej/received_events",
  "type": "User",
  "site_admin": false,
  "name": "Joey Lawrance",
  "company": "Wentworth Institute of Technology",
  "blog": "http://joeylawrance.com",
  "location": "Boston, MA",
  "email": "joey.lawrance@gmail.com",
  "hireable": null,
  "bio": null,
  "public_repos": 72,
  "public_gists": 4,
  "followers": 55,
  "following": 60,
  "created_at": "2011-02-04T17:34:13Z",
  "updated_at": "2016-02-11T15:20:41Z"
}
----

Because the result is http://jsonprettyprint.com/[JSON] (JavaScript Object Notation),
it is easy to work with in JavaScript, as shown in `ajax.html`.

http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html[JavaScript minifier].
Minified code appears to compress better with gzip (often used in HTTP),
hence the reason we see it.

== March 16: Debugging Node

Atom can debug Node, which is way more helpful than `console.log` or `console.error`.
To setup Atom to debug Node, do this:

. Open the Terminal. Get the path to Node.
+
----
which node
----
+
You may see something like this. Whatever it is, remember that path for Atom:
+
----
/usr/local/bin/node
----
. Open Atom.
. `Atom` -> `Open Your Config` and add lines like these to `config.cson` (replace the path as necessary):
+
----
"node-debugger":
  nodePath: "/usr/local/bin/node"
----
. Install `node-debugger`.
. Restart Atom.

The Node debugger is available from the command line and has a gdb-style interface.
You could use it directly, but now that `node-debugger` is setup, let's use it to debug.

. Run your application in the debugger in the Terminal.
+
----
# Debug code deployed to Heroku
heroku run node debug ./bin/www
# Debug code locally with Heroku settings
heroku local:run node debug ./bin/www
# debug code locally as-is
node debug ./bin/www
----
. Then, in your project in Atom, go to `Packages` -> `Node Debugger` -> `Attach`.
. You can toggle breakpoints with `F9`, step, run, examine locals and the call stack as you would in a typical IDE.

== Paramaters in URLs

Express uses the `:` to denote a variable in a route:

----
app.get('/user/:id/docs', function(req, res) {
   var id = req.params.id;
});
----
